## Mission Statement
Welcome to the repo! This is meant to serve as a place for me to re-familiarize myself with web-development (something I've not really touched since 2019) and learn about new CSS options as well as new Javascript libraries.

I'm also interested to see how it is working with ChatGPT to develop code. I wanted to pus hit to it's limit and outline what did work and what didn't work during the development cycle.

## What This Site Isn't

This site **is not** meant to serve as a *blog*, or as my main *photography portfolio*. The site's only meant to show some of my favorite photos of mine on Github pages.

It'll also serve as a place for me to try and learn more about what types of animations are available with Javascript.

I'm also going to try and better document the code I'm using as opposed to following my normal web design flow of:

1. Google (or ask ChatGPT) the web-design behavior I'm looking for.
2. Cmd+C.
3. Cmd+V.
4. Debug pasted code until it does what I want.

I have nothing against this approach, and you can do a lot with it. However, I'm looking to get a better grasp of what I'm doing and try and really understand what I'm writing.
